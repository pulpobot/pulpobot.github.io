    <h2>Hi. I'm Santiago.</h2>
    <p>
        I recently graduated with a Bachelor of Science in Game Programming
        from Champlain College in Burlington, Vermont. During the year I worked
        on Sagittarii Run, a high speed racing game set in space, with a team
        consisting of 1 producer, 3 programmers, 4 designers, and 3 artists.
        I'm currently working at Square Enix Montreal as a Programming Intern
        until the end of August.

        Since childhood, I've developed an immense interest in technology. I grew
        up in California, and spent large sums of time playing console games on
        the Atari, Nintendo, and PlayStation. In addition to playing games, I
        often spent the remainder of my time on a skateboard or
        Go Ped outside. I frequently used those to
        ride to a nearby 7/11 or Jack in the Box (oh, do I miss their tacos now).
        Having left California for Vermont, I miss the expansive selection of food,
        and I particuliarly miss In-N-Out Burger and Mexican food.

        About ten years ago, our family decided to pack up and move East. After
        a lot of searching, we ended up in the quaint state of Vermont.
        While we left a lot behind in California, we've come to enjoy or new life
        in the cold climate. Vermont has yielded us a safe and educationally
        friendly environment that has led me to a future in programming.

        With a deep interest in games and programming, I chose to attend
        Champlain College for their outstanding game program. The past three
        years have given me a great foundation for game development, and I'm
        excited to expand my knowledge in the field. I spent the summer after my
        junior year at Champlain working as a mobile programmer on an iOS travel
        application at the Emergent Media Center.
    </p>
    <p>
        Working at the Emergent Media Center has given me the chance to apply
        my knowledge in programming in a serious work environment. During my
        time there I became very comfortable with programming in a work
        environment. While I enjoyed working on a mobile application, I'm ready
        to move on to a position in the game industry.
    </p>

        Before working the summer at the Emergent Media Center, I spent the previous
        five summers working in construction. In that time I was involved in
        rebuilding the second story of a house to constructing cabinets. I've
        been involved in countless projects that have shown me the real meaning
        of work and the importance of perfecting the product I create. While
        many of the days were long and grueling, I enjoyed them because I knew that
        I had a hand in the finished product. I'm glad I had a chance to have
        consistintaly work in a field outside of programming; it has broadened
        my sight and given me another major skillset.
    </p>
    <p>
        While I enjoyed my time in construction, I know that programming is an art
        that I want to take part in for the rest of my life.
