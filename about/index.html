    <h2>Hi. I'm Santiago.</h2>
    <p>
		I'm finishing my studies on Systems Engineering at Universidad Nacional
		of Colombia and at the same time I'm working as an Intern in Cocodrilo Dog Games
		until the end of July; with a team consisting of one producer, two programmers and three
		artists.
    </p>
    <p>
		I dedicated (and I'm still doing it) a lot of time to play games since I was a small kid, 
		due to that my family had some sort of Arcade full with different kind of consoles where people 
		could pay to play some hours, so one thing took to the other and I ended being the most active "client".
    </p>
    <p>
		Then, when I was almost finishing school, I was starting to think what I wanted to do with my life
		and one day I bought Warcraft III from Blizzard and when the firsts cinematics shown up on my screen
		I was totally fascinated, so once again, one thing took to another:
		I ended up deciding that Video Games were my thing.
    </p>
    <p>
		I started attending at University to study Systems Engineering because I thought it was a good way to learn
		to program and create games, but none of the courses were about making games (as expected),
		so I ended up, not getting home to rest after class, but instead,
		to learn how to create games, this became one of my major skills: I'm Autodidact.
    </p>
    <p>
	Years later, I managed to get a job on the game industry through Cocodrilo Dog Games, learn how to 
	work with artists and programmers hand by hand to develop great products.
	Even if I enjoy a lot doing games, you can also find me doing other stuff like:
	
	<p>
	<b>Teaching</b><br>
	Some days of the week, you may find me teaching at the Universidad Nacional, 
	specifically in Game Design and Development in Unity.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	<b>Helping to grow the local industry</b><br>
	I'm one of the guys making possible the development of InterAction, a forum of game development opened to all the community in the local industry of videogames in Medell√≠n.
	<br>You can join us at the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Desarrollo-de-Videojuegos-en-Medellin/">InterAction Meetup Page</a> or in our <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/InterActionforo">Facebook Group</a>
	</p>
	
	<p>
	<b>Playing Piano and Drawing</b><br>
	Music and Art are the best ways I have found to keep being creative.
	</p>
	
	
	<p>
	<b>Learning</b><br>
	I'm always reading and searching for stuff, any kind of stuff, from video game development through dark matter and even how to construct a potato clock.
	The more you know, the more you can create.	
	</p>
	

	<p>
	<b>Travelling</b><br>
	I like to read, but I also like to experience, live and know new places, cultures, people and everything that can teach more about the world and the people living in it, after all we are making games for them, isn't it?
