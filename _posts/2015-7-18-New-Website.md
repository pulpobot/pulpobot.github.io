Around August of 2014, I started creating my own Portfolio website to show
my projects and career details, but even before that I wanted it to be also a Blog,
where I could post some of the "labs" or personal projects that I do, in fact,
I usually write some "self-tutorials" that I believe can be helpful to me in the
future.

## Going Jekyll

With the previous version of my website I was paying for the hosting and
the domain, but after finding that Github can host web pages as if they where
repositories using [*Jekyll*](http://jekyllrb.com/); I instantly searched for a theme that could allow me to
present information as a blog but at the same time show some of my Resume and
personal information.

Sadly (or not), I didn't find anything commercial out there that really filled my needs,
until I found the Portfolio page of [*Chris Brough*](http://chrisbrough.com/),
which uses a theme that He wrote and I was really happy with; so I went to his repositories, downloaded it and
started learning by doing.

### Re-writing and learning

I love the original version of Chris's website, all the Styling and features,
but I wanted a little more than that.

I always have been a fan of "A picture is worth a thousand words", and I
believe that if the small titles linking to each of the post at the Home page,
have a small picture of what is going to be inside the post, the reader can be attracted 
more easily to read it.

So that's why I needed to Re-write the layouts to show some thumbnails
 at the Home page, but I didn't have experience with Jekyll before, 
 only with some of CSS, HTML and Bootstrap, but I always end thinking 
 "What the hell, let's do this!", reading and changing code to 
 see how it reacts.

That's how I ended with a new version of my website in which I can keep my
Portfolio and my "self-tutorials"; if any one else can find them useful too
I will be glad that this has been useful for some one else.

### Replacing the old one

Once I managed to add some other features missing in the original one (like subtitles for the posts)
I started porting everything of the old website to the new format that this layouts uses,
and I'm pretty happy with the end product and how easy it can be to create new posts and projects.

Thanks a lot to Chris Brough for it's tremendous work in this.
