Light is vertical scrolling platformer with focus on the preservation of light.
The goal is to reach the end of the level before the light reaches zero; along
the way, the player can pick batteries which will recharge the light's battery.

The game incorporated a number of techniques that I learned during a 2D
graphics course taught by [John
Pile](http://alaska-john-portfolio.blogspot.com/) at Champlain College. The
techniques consist of particle effects, shaders, parallaxing, animations,
interpolation, and more.

## Technology

Light was developed using XNA 4.0, and it's configured to run on both the PC
and the Xbox 360.

## Gameplay

As a graphically focused game, gameplay is limited to the preservation of light
and the search for an exit. Navigation consists of walking and jumping. At one
point during development I prototyped a climb function, which works but needs
improvement before it's added game.

## Design

The following images show the basic concept before development started. The
only features that remain incomplete are the enemies and elevators. Since the
project was used to demonstrate 2D graphics techniques, enemies were not
critical; however, if I decide to continue working on this project, enemies and
several additional game objects will be added.

## Editor

During the development of **Light**, I built an in game level editor. New
levels can be constructed in-game on the PC or Xbox 360 using a keyboard or
gamepad. The editor is configured to expand *infinitely* in the vertical
direction and with some minor modification the levels can be expanded in the
horizontal direction as well.

**Important Editor Functions:**

* Cycle through tiles
* Set tile position
* Set tile rotation
* Set tile depth (0 to 1)
* Quickly place tiles
* Increase/Decrease rows (vertical height)
* Change background color
* Change levels
* Save levels

The editor uses the tiles pulled in from the games texture atlas. Here's
a subset of the tiles contained in the atlas:

![Editor](/images/light/tiles.png)

Levels are read in and saved out to XML files. The level XML files look
something like:

{% highlight xml %}
<Level>
    <Entity>
        <ID>0</ID>
        <Rotation>0</Rotation>
        <Origin>
            <X>0</Y>
            <Y>0</Y>
        </Origin>
    </Entity>
</Level>
{% endhighlight %}

The editor currently functions as indented, but the addition of a GUI interface
would simplify the level creation process. Currently the only way of viewing
tiles is by cycling through them one by one, it would be much easier to scroll
though a visual list that presents multiple tiles at once. Providing menus and
mouse input in addition to the keyboard controls would simplify some of the
complex keyboard and gamepad input.

## Light Shader

The following HLSL shader is used to create a gradient circle around the
player. The size of the circle will changes according to the remaining battery
power.

{% highlight c %}
uniform extern texture screen_texture;

sampler screen = sampler_state
{
    Texture = <screen_texture>;
};

float radius;
float2 center_coord;

float4 PixelShaderFunction(float2 tex_coord: TEXCOORD0) : COLOR
{
    float4 color = tex2D(screen, tex_coord);
    float current_radius = abs((pow((tex_coord[0] - center_coord[0]) *
        1.77777777778, 2)) + (pow(tex_coord[1] - center_coord[1], 2)));

    current_radius = sqrt(current_radius);

    if (current_radius < radius)
    {
        color[0] *= 1 - (current_radius/radius);
        color[1] *= 1 - (current_radius/radius);
        color[2] *= 1 - (current_radius/radius);
    }
    else if (current_radius > radius)
    {
        color[0] = 0;
        color[1] = 0;
        color[2] = 0;
    }

    return color;
}

technique
{
    pass P0
    {
        PixelShader = compile ps_2_0 PixelShaderFunction();
    }
}
{% endhighlight %}

## Battery Particle Effect

The core of *Light* is the preservation of the battery power. Batteries have
been placed throughout the levels to refill the player's battery. When the
player collides with a battery pack the shell of the battery breaks away
leaving the battery power. The visual feedback for the shell breaking is
generated using a particle effect:

{% highlight csharp %}
acceleration_multiplier : member float // set to -= 0.001f

sprite : Texture2D     // set to preferred image (e.g., one pixel white line)
direction : Vector2    // set to random direction
position : Vector2     // set to random position around emitter origin
velocity : Vector2     // set to zero
acceleration : Vector2 // set to direction * acceleration_multiplier
rotation : float       // set to zero
rotation_rate: float   // set to random / 2.0f
initial_scale : float  // set to 1.5f
final_scale : float    // set to 0.1f
initial_color : float  // set to White
final_color : float    // set to White
age : int              // set to random between 0 and 10
fade_age : int         // set to preferred particle duration
{% endhighlight %}

[post](/project/2011/09/Particle-Effects/).

## Character Animation

![Animation](/images/light/animation.png)

While developing the game I didn't have time to create a character walking
animation, so I used a circle that gradually rotated to demonstrate the
functionality. The animation will change according to the characters current
velocity. While cel animations work well for simple animations, a more robust
skeletal animation system would allow for more flexibility. When I have more
time, I'd like to work on developing a 2D skeletal animation system.

    change frame (not taking time or velocity into account):
        frame count++
        if (frame count >= number of frames)
            current frame = 0
