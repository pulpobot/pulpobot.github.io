Ink Runner puts the player in the control of a young shaman in a constant run to escape from the
 Earth's spirit and find a way to lock it again; the spirit was accidentally woken up by the shaman,
 and has realized what humans have been doing to the Earth.

Ink Runner puts the player in the control of a young shaman in a constant run to escape from the Earth's spirit and find a way to lock it again; 
the spirit was accidentally woken up by the shaman, and has realized what humans have been doing to the Earth.</p>

I believe that one of my greatest success with this project was giving a pitch in front of almost 200 people
at the RutaN facilities, including possible investors, journalists, teachers, friends and family! (Scary as Hell!).</p>
This project was designed and developed for the Certificate in Video Games Development; 
it was developed in a team of 3 people,
I was one of the game designers and i focused mainly on the development of the camera's movement, character mechanics and movements and the
animation integration from <a href="http://esotericsoftware.com/">Spine (a 2D Animation Software)</a> into Unity.</p>
