Dot is a simple game built with Flash. The player must move the green dot
around the screen to pickup collectibles. During collection the player must
fight to keep the green dot under control, while avoiding enemies. The game was
built during an introductory game course at Champlain College. Using an
accessible tool like Flash, it was easy to grasp important game concepts that
would become prevalent in the development of future game projects. The concepts
included, but were not limited to game state (e.g., start game, end game, level
change), player, enemies, objects, collisions, physics, and heads-up display.

## Levels

As the player progresses through the game, the playable space decreases, and
the game becomes increasingly difficult. The game tracks score, health,
time, items collected, and bombs. The critical pieces of information are
presented in visual bars, which scale according to the state of the information.

After the success or failure of a level, a screen will be presented to show the
current score and the result of the level. If the player succeeded, then they
will be presented with the next level when ready; otherwise, the player will be
sent back to the beginning of the game.

![End Screens](/images/dot/end-screens.png)

The game, while simple, is still missing a some important elements, including
a main menu, a pause menu, a help menu, and visual cues (e.g., tell the user to
press a specific button at the end of a level to continue or restart). In
future game projects, I would mitigate or resolve these issues.

## How to Play

### Controls

* Arrow Keys - Control the green ball.
* Spacebar - Clears all enemies (i.e. bomb)
* Left Click - To continue on Win/Lose/Next level screens

### Rules

To beat level the player must collect 10 items (the blue item bar will fill as
they are collected). Each item collected will add 1000 to your score. Hitting
a wall will remove one item from the collected items, and subtract 250 from
score. Hitting an enemy will take a quarter of your health, and subtract 500
points from score. Using a bomb will clear all enemies, and add 200 points to
your score for each enemy removed. In addition to the normal points, you'll earn
bonus points for the time remaining at the end of the level.
