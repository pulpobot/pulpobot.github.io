"BEAT BOY is an autorunner platformer where
player’s actions are related to different musical
mechanics. It is a cutting edge rhythm-adventure
game developed with a proprietary beat
matching technology where music is perfectly
synchronized with action. The game features
outstanding graphics, brilliant electronic music
and multi-player gaming. BEAT BOY combines a
player’s audio and visual senses together in a
journey through a teenager’s dream/nightmare
world!"

I worked on this game as part of the team at <a href="http://www.cocodrilodog.com/" target="_blank">Cocodrilo Dog Games</a>
for around 4 months, also in the audio engine plugins for Unity that allowed the music synchronization with the gameplay.
it was published on Steam Greenlight and presented to multiple posible publishers which where interested
on it ( psst: including Bandai Namco ;) )

## Media

Besides the gameplay video at the top of this post, you can check some other features built into the engine

<br/>
####Level Editor - Unity Editor Extension
This is my prefered feature for this game that I coded: a platforms level editor!
It allowed the team to randomize the models for the platforms, 
align them, put as many as needed at the exact position, everything with just a button.

<br/>
####Animations Memory System
The game allows the player rewind the last actions he has made ( a real challenge for the dev team), so, I created 
a channel between the 'actions memory system' to be able to rewind the related animations and blend them together.
<br/>
( A perfect looped gif thanks to this system ;) )
