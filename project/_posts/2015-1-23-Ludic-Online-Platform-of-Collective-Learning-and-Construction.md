This is a project in development of the research group GUIAME of the Universidad Nacional of Colombia, 
for this project I have been designing and developing everything in it, except from the art.

This is one of my favorite projects because it has allowed me to write a paper, travel through Europe 
and give a speech at PAAMS' 15 at Spain, you can know more about this at this other post

and how a common person can become an agent of change in a post-conflict ambience 
through a massive multi-player online videogame.
